# AML Custom Skill Template

Run these two Jupyter notebooks to quickly train and deploy a document classification model as a custom skill for Cognitive Search.

Walk through the two Jupyter Notebooks for instructions on how to train, deploy, and integrate a custom skill using Azure Machine Learning.

> This template does not currently use the [AML Custom skill format](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-aml-skill) that's available in public preview but rather is designed to be deployed as a conventional [Web API skill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-web-api). There's a separate tutorial that walks through the process of [creating an AML skill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-aml-custom-skill) based off of that functionality.
