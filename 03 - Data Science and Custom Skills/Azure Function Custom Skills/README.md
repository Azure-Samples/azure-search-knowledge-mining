# Custom skills have moved!

The custom skills and templates that were previously in this directory can now be found in their new home,
[the Power Skills repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills).

[Power Skills](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills) are a collection of useful functions to be deployed as custom skills for Azure Cognitive Search. The skills can be used as [templates](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills/blob/master/Template/HelloWorld/README.md) or starting points for your own custom skills, or they can be deployed and used as they are if they happen to meet your requirements. We also invite you to contribute your own work by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills/compare).
